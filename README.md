# wb-challenge

A simple React app that loads in a carousel of movie-related images and text, taking advantage of the Neutrino tool for building zero-configuration JavaScript applications. The carousel implements the popular Flickity slider, which is responsive, touch-friendly, and can handle graphics of variable size and aspect ratio.
